## Needs to be removed
- Settings:
    - Discount Section
    - Payment Terms
    - Bank Details
    
## Additional Items
- I know this is intirely optional but I want the work hours section details to also show in this table. Like , working days, total hours, hourly rate. Instead of having the mentioned data on a separate section, add it instead on the same table as  in the invoice pdf itself <promise>IMPLEMENTED<promise> make sure to do all the tests and it should be fully functional, performance and security must be top notch
